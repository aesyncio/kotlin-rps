# wtf is this?
this is a rps game i made in kotlin to learn it a bit better
# how to play?
install java and game.jar and run it, or you can build the jar file yourself
# how to build it myself
install kotlin, copy the code from main.kt to a file named main.kt then run
```

```
and boom, you got your game
