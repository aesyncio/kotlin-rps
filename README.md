# wtf is this?
this is a rps game i made in kotlin to learn it a bit better
# how to play?
install java and [game.jar](https://github.com/aesyncio/kotlin-rps/raw/main/game.jar) and run it, or you can build the jar file yourself
# how to build it myself
install kotlin, copy the code from [main.kt](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aesyncio/kotlin-rps/main/main.kt) to a file named main.kt then run
```
kotlinc main.kt -include-runtime -d game.jar
```
and boom, you got your game
